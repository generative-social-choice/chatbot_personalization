# Generative Social Choice: early chatbot personalization experiment

This repo contains the code and data associated with an early pilot experiment on chatbot personalization from the project *Generative Social Choice* ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01291), [general audience report](https://procaccia.info/GenSoc_OpenAI_report.pdf)). This experiment was conducted in November 2023 as part of OpenAI's [Democratic Inputs to AI program](https://openai.com/index/democratic-inputs-to-ai-grant-program-update/). 

**We've since conducted follow-up experiments which improve on this implementation.** For the code and data associated with the latest draft of *Generative Social Choice*, [click here](https://github.com/generative-social-choice/gsc_abortion). For the code and data associated with a follow-up paper [*Generative Social Choice: The Next Generation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22939) by Niclas Böhmer, Sara Fish, and Ariel Procaccia, [click here](https://github.com/sara-fish/gen-soc-choice-next-gen).

# Setup instructions 

1. In the folder where this `README.md` file is located, call `pip install -e .`
2. Install dependencies: `pipenv install`
3. Create a file `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `utils/`, and write in it your (personal) API key. 

# Overview of repo 

- `data/` has all cleaned and anonymized data associated with the experiments in the paper:
    - `chatbot_personalization_data.csv`: our cleaned and anonymized survey data, collected on Prolific. Also available [at the dedicated repo](https://github.com/generative-social-choice/chatbot_personalization_data)
    - `validate_disc_query_logs.csv`: logs from our discriminative query validation experiment (Figure 1, replicate with `paper_replication/validate_discriminative_query.py`)
    - `gen_query_eval/`: logs from our generative query evaluation experiment (Figure 2, replicate with `paper_replication/gen_query_eval.py`)
    - `user_summaries_generation.csv` and `user_summaries_generation_raw_output.csv`: the user summaries (and logs) used in our slate generation (replicate with `paper_replication/generate_summaries.py`)
    - `ratings_and_matching.csv`: assignments of validation users to statements (Figures 4-5, replicate with `paper_replication/compute_matching.py`)
- `paper_replication/` has scripts for replicating the experiments in the paper:
    - `validate_discriminative_query.py`: validating discriminative queries (Figure 1)
    - `gen_query_eval.py`: evaluating generative queries (Figure 2)
    - `generate_summaries.py`: generating user summaries 
    - `generate_slate.py`: generating slate
    - `compute_matching.py`: compute assignment of users to statements in slate (Figures 4-5)
- `plots/` has code for generating each of the plots in the paper, and the plots themselves
- `queries/` has implementation of the queries:
    - `query_chatbot_personalization.py` contains all of the chatbot personalization specific implementation 
    - `query_interface.py` describes the interface for agents and generators. Anything that implements this interface should automatically work with our slate generation code. 
- `slates/` has our implementation of the slate generation algorithm in `generate_slate_ensemble_greedy.py`
- `test/` has unit tests
- `utils/` has miscellaneous tools
    - `gpt_wrapper.py` contains code for making LLM calls 
    - `helper_functions.py` has `get_base_dir_path()` and `get_time_string()`
    - `dataframe_completion.py` contains code for df-completion style LLM calls, used for our summary generation and generative query.

# Generating plots from paper 

Each figure in the paper can be generated using a dedicated notebook:
* Figure 1: `plots/fig1_disc_query_eval.ipynb`
* Figure 2: `plots/fig2_slate_composition.ipynb`
* Figure 3: N/A
* Figure 4: `plots/fig4_assigned_utilities_pie_chart.ipynb`
* Figure 5: `plots/fig5_assigned_utilities_histogram.ipynb`

# Testing instructions 

## Quick testing

To run unit tests with `gpt-4o-mini`, run the following command. 
```
python -m unittest -k fast -v 
``` 

## Slower testing for replication

To run unit tests using the exact LLMs used in the paper (for replication purposes), run the following command. This requires access to `gpt-4-base` and `gpt-4-32k-0613`.
```
python -m unittest -k replication -v
```

To run all unit tests, run the following command. This requires access to `gpt-4-base` and `gpt-4-32k-0613`.
```
python -m unittest -v
```

# Replicating paper instructions 

## Quick replication

The quickest and cheapest way to rerun our experiments is to use a more modern LLM such as `gpt-4o`. The below commands run the exact experiments from our paper, except `gpt-4o` is used in place of `gpt-4-base` and `gpt-4-32k-0613`. 

### Generate summaries of users
Generate summaries of all users:
```
python paper_replication/generate_summaries.py --model gpt-4o
```

Generate summary for a single user (for testing):
```
python paper_replication/generate_summaries.py --model gpt-4o --num_agents 1
```


### Empirical validation of discriminative query
To run the full experiment empirically validating the discriminative query (600 LLM calls):
```
python paper_replication/validate_discriminative_query.py --model gpt-4o
```
To empirically validate a single discriminative query (for testing):
```
python paper_replication/validate_discriminative_query.py --model gpt-4o --num_samples 1
```

### Empirical evaluation of generative query
To run the full experiment empirically evaluating the generative query:
```
python paper_replication/gen_query_eval.py --model gpt-4o
```
To evaluate a single ensemble round (for testing):
```
python paper_replication/gen_query_eval.py --model gpt-4o --num_rounds 1
```

### Generating slate
To generate a slate for all users:
```
python paper_replication/generate_slate.py --model gpt-4o
```
To generate a slate for only 10 users (for testing):
```
python paper_replication/generate_slate.py --model gpt-4o --num_agents 10
```

## "Exact" reproduction (subject to LLM stochasticity)

To "exactly" (subject to inherent LLM stochasticity) reproduce our experiments, run the below commands. These require access to `gpt-4-base` and `gpt-4-32k-0613`. These will write logs to `data/chatbot_personalization/demo_data/`. To test on smaller sample sizes, use the `--num_agents` and `--num_samples` arguments (usage demonstrated above). 


### Generate summaries of users
```
python paper_replication/generate_summaries.py --model default
```

### Empirical validation of discriminative query
```
python paper_replication/validate_discriminative_query.py --model default
```

### Empirical evaluation of generative query
```
python paper_replication/gen_query_eval.py --model default
```

### Generating slate
```
python paper_replication/generate_slate.py --model default
```

### Match validation users to slate statements 

This step uses Gurobi, but no LLM calls.

```
python paper_replication/compute_matching.py
```
